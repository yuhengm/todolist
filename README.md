# TO-Do List App

This is a mini to-do list app with a few heart-warming default entries. This is an app bind to one single user, so it is more collaborative.

User can access __Today__, __Home__, __Work__, and __Other__ categories of your lists, add and delete enties as you like. If some errors occurs, you will be directed to a dedicated error page.
